Arrays has some problems:
Search is slow in normal array. Solution Ordered Array, but insertion is slow.
Normal Array or Ordered Array - Deletion is slow.

What is Solution: Linked List. Most used after Array.
Suitable for General purpose Databases.
Unless u need fast access with Index - almost all Array scenario we can use LL.
LL can implement Stack and Queue instead of Array.

1. LINKED LIST
2. DOUBLE ENDED LIST
3. SORTED LIST
4. DOUBLY LINKED LIST
5. LIST WITH ITERATOR.

ADT - Abstract Data Type - eg. Stack Queue.
You can implement with Array or LL.


LinkedList Efficiency:

1. Insert First/Delete First - O(1) - Always happen at front.
2. Search/Delete - O(N) but Delete is more efficient that array as it doesnt need to copy/move all elements.
3. Memory advantage - Linked list is more memory efficient as it uses only the required amount of data. Exact amount of memory.
When needed it expand to the available memory. But Array size is fixed, which is some times inefficient.
Too much memory or too less memory.

Vectors - double in size when size is reached. But solution is not as efficient as Array.
