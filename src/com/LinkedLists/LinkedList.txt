Arrays has some problems:
Search is slow in normal array. Solution Ordered Array, but insertion is slow.
Normal Array or Ordered Array - Deletion is slow.

What is Solution: Linked List. Most used after Array.
Suitable for General purpose Databases.
Unless u need fast access with Index - almost all Array scenario we can use LL.
LL can implement Stack and Queue instead of Array.

1. LINKED LIST
2. DOUBLE ENDED LIST
3. SORTED LIST
4. DOUBLY LINKED LIST
5. LIST WITH ITERATOR.  

ADT - Abstract Data Type - eg. Stack Queue.
You can implement with Array or LL.
