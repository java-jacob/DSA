Arrays
-------
Consecutive memory allocation.
Set/Get based on Index - O(1)
Search/Delete - O(N)

Ordered Array
------------
Search - O(logN) - binary search Algorithm.
But insert is now O(N)
used in Frequent Search - eg. Employee Record - hiring/firing is infrequent.




Important Algorithms
--------------------
1. Binary Search in Ordered Array.
2. Ordered Array insert.
3. Insert element at a particular location in Array.
4. Delete element at a particular location in Array and compacting the array.


Algorithm & Big O
-----------------
1. Linear Search - O(N)
2. Binary Search - O(log N)
3. Insertion in Unordered Array - O(1)
4. Insertion in Ordered Array - O(N)
5. Deletion in Unordered Array - O(N)
6. Deletion in Ordered Array - O(N)
